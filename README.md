**CITATIONS:**

Date: 3/17/2024
The majority of code within this project was adapted from OSU's CS340 nodejs_starter_app
Source URL: https://github.com/osu-cs340-ecampus/nodejs-starter-app

**JavaScript delete files:**

All files within the js folder are nearly identical to the starter code referenced above. Only function and table names have been updated.

**HBS files:** 

table_name.hbs files within the layouts folder are also based on the starter code referenced above. Table input fields have been modified to add additional input fields, as well as a second HTML form for updating fields. In order to facilitate passing data using multiple queries, some of the data values have been updated to differentiate which query data is being referenced.

**app.js:** 

This file is also based on the starter code referenced above. More routes have been added for GET, POST, and DELETE to coincide with the additional HTML forms referenced above. These routes were all modified based to work with a different database. Many of the GET routes were heavily modified to query and pass additional data to each form. 

**Other:** 

The main.hbs file is also based on the starter code referenced above. The website name was updated to fit this project. Navigation links are original code and were added. 

Extensive comments were added to support clarity and readability.
